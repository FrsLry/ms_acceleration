## Description

This repository contains the scripts to reproduce the statistical analyses, figures, a reproducible example to fit the dynamic *N*-mixture model for the Blue Jay, and a correlative analysis between patterns of accelerating decline and covariates. This is how it is structured:

* **Dynamic N-mixture models:** The dynamic *N*-mixture model can be found in `.\model\jagsModel.txt` and can be used to reproduce the results. We created a reproducible example with the Blue Jay in `.\scripts\example_blue_jay.R`. The species can be changed by changing the variable `species` in the script. Please note that it may take *ca.* 2 days for the model to fit. The data provided contains the input data for 564 species. The summary of the models can be found in `.\summary_models\`. 

* **Propagating uncertainty in mixed models:** The second part of the analysis can be found in `.\mixed_model\`. There are 3 scripts to samples the chains at the routes/species, family and habitat levels. The mixed models can be fit by using the scripts in `.\mixed_model\script_fitting\`. The commented model is: `.\mixed_model\script_fitting\trend_model_N_spatial.R`.

* **Figures:** The figures can be recreated using the script `.\mixed_model\figures.R`. 

* **Coincidence between hotspots of acceleration and other variables:** We explored how environmental and anthropogenic variables correlate with the patterns of acceleration, and change in abundance using Random Forests and variable importance analyses. These analyses can be found in `.\change_vs_environment\`. 

* **Note:** The absolute growth rate (`g` in the main text) is noted as `absg` in the code, and the per-capita growth rate (`r` in the main text) is noted as `g` in the code. Scripts will be updated later on the github repository. 

## System requirements

All the dynamic *N*-mixture models were fit on the [Ohio Supercomputer Center ](https://www.oh-tech.org/) under Linux operating system with JAGS ver. 4.3.0. This repository was created on Windows 10, with R ver. 4.2.1.
