## Description

This repository contains the scripts to reproduce the statistical analyses, figures, and a reproducible example to fit the dynamic *N*-mixture model for the Blue Jay. This is how it is structured:

* **Dynamic N-mixture models:** the dynamic *N*-mixture model can be found in `.\model\jagsModel.txt` and can be used to reproduce the results. We created a reproducible example with the Blue Jay in `.\scripts\example_blue_jay.R`. The species can be changed by changing the variable `species` in the script. Please note that it may take *ca.* 2 days for the model to fit. The data provided contains the input data for 564 species. The summary of the models can be found in `.\summary_models\`. 

* **Propagating uncertainty in mixed models:** the second part of the analysis can be found in `.\mixed_model\`. There are 3 scripts to samples the chains at the routes/species, family and habitat levels. The mixed models can be fit by using the scripts in `.\mixed_model\script_fitting\`. The commented model is: `.\mixed_model\script_fitting\trend_model_N_spatial.R`.

* **Figures:** The figures can be recreated using the script `.\mixed_model\figures.R`. 

* **Simulations:** In `.\simulations\`, users can use a simulation framework, with known recruitment and survival parameters, and then use the dynamic N-mixture model (Dail & Madsen 2011) to correctly estimate the recruitment and survival parameters. Users are invited to test several values of parameters. Also accessible [here](https://frslry.github.io/ms_acceleration/simulations/simulations.html).  

## System requirements

All the dynamic *N*-mixture models were fit on the [Ohio Supercomputer Center ](https://www.oh-tech.org/) under Linux operating system with JAGS ver. 4.3.0. This repository was created on Windows 10, with R ver. 4.2.1.
